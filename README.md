# Assignment Part 2: Sending & Storing Messages  
**Course:** PROG5121 â€” Programming 1A

## Overview

In **Part 2**, I extend the earlier Registration/Login system to support sending **text messages**, computing a **hash** for each message, and persisting messages to disk in **JSON** format.

The application allows users to:
- Create and validate messages
- Check recipient phone numbers
- Generate unique message IDs and hashes
- Validate message length
- Send, disregard, or store messages
- Persist messages to JSON files
- Run automated tests with JUnit 5
